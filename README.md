# RoleRadar

A lightweight job-tracking tool that monitors selected company career pages
and highlights new postings with keyword and location filters.

## Why
LinkedIn is noisy and does not reliably show what is new.
This tool provides deterministic, daily visibility into roles that matter.

## Features
- Multi-company tracking (e.g. MathWorks, Amazon)
- Daily diff of new postings
- Keyword search
- Location filtering (multi-select)
- Simple SQLite storage
- Streamlit UI

## Tech Stack
- Python
- SQLite
- Streamlit

## Status
Feature-frozen. Intended for personal use and experimentation.
